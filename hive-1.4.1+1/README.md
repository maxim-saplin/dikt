Hive is a lightweight and blazing fast key-value database written in pure Dart. Inspired by [Bitcask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcask).

### [Documentation & Samples](https://docs.hivedb.dev/) üìñ

## Features

- üöÄ Cross platform: mobile, desktop, browser
- ‚ö° Great performance (see [benchmark](#benchmark))
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Simple, powerful, & intuitive API
- üîí Strong encryption built in
- üéà **NO** native dependencies
- üîã Batteries included


## Getting Started
Check out the [Quick Start](https://docs.hivedb.dev) documentation to get started.

## Usage

You can use Hive just like a map. It is not necessary to await `Futures`.

```dart
var box = Hive.box('myBox');

box.put('name', 'David');

var name = box.get('name');

print('Name: $name');
```

## Store objects

Hive not only supports primitives, lists and maps but also any Dart object you like. You need to generate a type adapter before you can store objects.

```dart
@HiveType(typeId: 0)
class Person extends HiveObject {

  @HiveField(0)
  String name;

  @HiveField(1)
  int age;
}
```

Extending `HiveObject` is optional but it provides handy methods like `save()` and `delete()`.

```dart
var box = await Hive.openBox('myBox');

var person = Person()
  ..name = 'Dave'
  ..age = 22;
box.add(person);

print(box.getAt(0)); // Dave - 22

person.age = 30;
person.save();

print(box.getAt(0)) // Dave - 30
```

## Hive ‚ù§Ô∏è Flutter
Hive was written with Flutter in mind. It is a perfect fit if you need a lightweight datastore for your app. After adding the required dependencies and initializing Hive, you can use Hive in your project:

```dart
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
import 'package:hive_flutter/hive_flutter.dart';

class SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ValueListenableBuilder(
      valueListenable: Hive.box('settings').listenable(),
      builder: (context, box, widget) {
        return Switch(
          value: box.get('darkMode'),
          onChanged: (val) {
            box.put('darkMode', val);
          }
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Boxes are cached and therefore fast enough to be used directly in the `build()` method of Flutter widgets.


## Benchmark

|1000 read iterations |1000 write iterations|
|:------------:|:------------:|
|	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hivedb/hive/master/.github/benchmark_read.png) |	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hivedb/hive/master/.github/benchmark_write.png) |
| SharedPreferences is on par with Hive when it comes to read performance. SQLite performs much worse. | Hive greatly outperforms SQLite and SharedPreferences when it comes to writing or deleting. |

The benchmark was performed on a Oneplus 6T with Android Q. You can [run the benchmark yourself](https://github.com/hivedb/hive_benchmark).

*Take this benchmark with a grain of salt. It is very hard to compare databases objectively since they were made for different purposes.
